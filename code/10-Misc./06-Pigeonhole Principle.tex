{\footnotesize
\begin{itemize}
\item At least 1 subarray of an array of length $N$ must be divisible by $N$.
\item Build all possible sequences of length 10 whose value is between 1 to 100. At least any two sequences will be same.
\item For $N>=100$, at least one 4-tuples XOR is 0.
\item For $N>20$ and $a_i<=10^6$, at least two subsets has same XOR. Because distinct XOR count can be $10^6$ and Total Subset $2^{20}>10^6$. Means there is a subset whose XOR is 0.
