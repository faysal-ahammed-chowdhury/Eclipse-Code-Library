{\small
Here, 
$f[i]$ = how many pairs/k-tuple such that their gcd is $i$ or it’s multiple (count of pairs those are divisible by $i$). \\ 
$g[i]$ = how many pairs/k-tuple such that their gcd is $i$. \\ 
$g[i]$ = $f[i] - \sum_{i \mid j} g[j]$. \\

\medskip

\textbf{Sum of all pair gcd:} \\

We know, how many pairs are there such that their gcd is $i$ for every $i$ (1 to $n$). So now,  
$\sum_{i=1}^{n} g[i] * i$. \\

\medskip

\textbf{Sum of all pair lcm (i = 1, j = 1):} \\
We know, 
$\text{lcm}(a, b) = \frac{a * b}{\text{gcd}(a,b)}$. \\
\medskip

Now, $f[i]$ = All pair product sum of those, whose gcd is $i$ or it’s multiple. \\ 
$g[i]$ = All pair product sum of those, whose gcd is $i$. \\

$\text{Ans} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{g[i]}{i}$. \\
\medskip

All pair product sum = $(a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_n) * (a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_n)$
